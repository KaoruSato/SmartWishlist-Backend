"description":"Do you sometimes just want to chill out and read a good book in the evening? Then, 5 minutes later you find yourself sucked into Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Candy Crush... you name it. This app offers a bit more of a \"hardcore\" approach to getting rid of your addiction.\n\nYou set the amount of time that you want to stay focused and just press start. Until the focus session is over, you canâ€™t turn off or minimize the app. If you do, the focus session will fail and your success rate stats will suffer. The app stays on for the entire duration of the session. Battery usage is minimal because screen is dimmed. Your phone and all the distractions that come with it are basically blocked.\n\nDo you have a nasty habit of checking your social networks, messenger apps, news sites, just before going to bed? Turn on the focus session one or two hours before sleep. Once the time is up your phone will silently turn off the Focus app and the screen. You can finally go to sleep without cluttering your head beforehand. No more mobile addiction induced insomnia. You can invite more mindfulness into your life.\n\nThis app provides clear statistics displaying how many of your focus sessions were successful and how many times you did not make it to the end.\n\nTreat yourself with some precious iPhone-free time; you play a game of focus against yourself. Can you win?", "artistId":796940855, "artistName":"Pawel Urbanek", "genres":["Health & Fitness", "Productivity"], "price":2.99, "bundleId":"net.pabloweb.focus", "trackId":1197355361, "trackName":"Let me Focus", "primaryGenreName":"Health & Fitness", "isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true, "releaseDate":"2017-02-08T10:24:09Z", "primaryGenreId":6013, "averageUserRating":4.0, "userRatingCount":9}]
